# Serene
Women's Safety App

User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

1. As a woman in a dangerous situation, I want to be able to discreetly send a silent alert to emergency services using the new communication solution, so that I can get help without alerting my abuser and increasing my risk of harm.
2. As a person witnessing a potentially dangerous situation, I want to be able to discreetly use the new communication solution on behalf of someone in need, so that I can help them access help without putting them at further risk
3. As a woman in a dangerous situation, I want the app's user interface to change its appearance with each launch, so that my abuser remains unaware of the app and its purpose, while still allowing me to use the emergency activation features quickly and intuitively in a critical moment (without the need for explicit instructions).

### **Goal**

Enable a woman in a dangerous situation or allies witnessing a potentially dangerous situation to discreetly send a silent alert to emergency services using the new communication solution.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- The app's user interface (UI) must dynamically change key visual elements with each launch, including (but not limited to):
    - Background colors
    - Button styles and icons
    - Text fonts and sizes
    - Layout configuration
- Critical elements for emergency activation (e.g., designated button, voice command phrase, gesture recognition) must remain consistent in functionality and location across UI variations.
- The app should be designed with intuitive user experience principles in mind, promoting discoverability and ease of use of the emergency features through:
    - Clear and consistent iconography that is easily recognizable regardless of the current UI style.
    - Simple and intuitive placement of critical elements within the UI layout.
    - Minimal reliance on text instructions to minimize the risk of revealing the app's purpose.

*Additional Considerations:*

*The dynamic UI changes should be predictable and intuitive within a defined framework, allowing users to adapt quickly and recognize the key functionalities regardless of the specific layout or visual elements.*
